re: oclean all



rules: all, clean, fclean, oclean, re


variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS
CC: the compiler to be used
SRC: the .c files
OBJ: the .o files
NAME: the name of the executable
RM: the program to delete files
CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail

You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
